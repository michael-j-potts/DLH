Our MIMIC-III data set was sourced from PhysioNet after completing the required CITI training
course "Working with healthcare data for research". Further, the authors of the paper provided 
us with "process_mimic.py" to preprocess the data.

To begin, the code was in python 2.7, and depended upon several depreciated dependancies. Further, 
several minor code alterations were required for unkknown reasons. This included altering the shape 
inputs/outputs, removing the authors ICD, Meds, and labs variable identifiers "i", "m", and "l". 
Further, to create the latent spaces CAE and AE, we created another file to take the processed mimic
files and alter their shapes, and convert them into embeddings. Once this was complete and the models 
were able to run, we updated the code into python 3. This process broke many more dependencies which 
required updating, and futher, it changed the results of our paper. The code in python 2 was quite 
similar to the  papers results with minor variations noted. As well, we 
implemented a mortality ablation. The paper specifically measured total deaths of patients who stayed 
in the ICU while our ablation focused on patients who died in hospital during/after staying in the ICU. 
We found a large improvement in the models predictive capabilities when it was run only with patients
who died in hospital.

To run our models, simply run the ./run_experiments.sh file, which will run the data preparation scrips, 
the embedding preparation scripts, the baseline models, the CLOUT models, and additional ablations that 
we have implemented in python3.
